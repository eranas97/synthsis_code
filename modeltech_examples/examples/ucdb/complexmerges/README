These examples show the following Questa features:

    * Shows various ways to manipulate UCDBs to facilitate a merge.

    Subdirectories:
        1) setup
           -- Execute this directory to populate the "common_ucdbs" directory.
	      Execute this before executing any of the "EXAMPLE_..."
	      directories.
        2) common_ucdbs
	   -- Holds UCDBs used by the "EXAMPLE_..." directories. This
	      directory is populated by executing the "setup" directory.
        3) EXAMPLE_libs_differ_merge
           -- Merge two identical designs compiled into different libraries.
              Modify a copy of a UCDB so that the DU library portion of its
	      DU names are made to be the same as those of another UCDB.
	      Then merge these UCDB files.
	4) EXAMPLE_du_merge
           -- Merge all instances of the specified design unit in all the 
	      input files. It then creates an output file consisting of one 
	      instance of the design unit, containing all the merged data.
        5) EXAMPLE_rename_merge
           -- Modify a copy of a UCDB so that an instance name of a DU is 
	      renamed to be the same as that of another UCDB.
	      Then merge these UCDB files.
        6) EXAMPLE_strip_merge
           -- Copies of the input UCDBs are stripped levels of hierarchy
	      until all UCDBs have the desired DUs at the top level.
	      Then merge these UCDB files.
        7) EXAMPLE_install_merge
           -- Copies of the input UCDBs have levels of hierarchy
	      installed until all UCDBs have the desired DUs at the same 
	      level. 
	      Then merge these UCDB files.
        8) EXAMPLE_move_merge
           -- Copies of the input UCDBs have empty levels of hierarchy
	      installed and the desired DUs are moved there. 
	      Then merge these UCDB files.
