OSCI SystemC TLM Standard
Kit Of 9 June 2008

This kit contains the proposed OSCI SystemC TLM 2.0
standard API, documentation, and examples.

SystemC 2.1.v1 and 2.2.0 are supported and have been tested.

Compared to the 29 Nov 2006 draft 1 kit, draft 2 has evolved in the following
primary ways:
  - Many of the features have undergone significant change:
    - Untimed modeling
    - Approximately timed modeling
    - The generic payload and its extension mechanism
    - Non-intrusive (debug) transactions
  - Several new features have been incorporated:
    - Loosely timed modeling
    - Temporal decoupling
    - Model synchronization
    - Direct memory interface (DMI)
  - Documentation (training presentation and users manual) is provided
  - Examples have been improved

There is no build procedure needed for the TLM library,
since the entire library is in '.h' files.

See also the README files in several of the directories
in this kit.
