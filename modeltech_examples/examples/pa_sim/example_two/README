This example shows the following Power Aware feature:

    * PDU-Based Simulation

Preliminary Information
-----------------------
For information about PDU-Based Simulation, please visit the Power Aware User 
Manual, Chapter 3, "PDU-Based Simulation" section.


Running the example
-------------------
A do file "run.do" has been included with this example in order to help you compile, 
optimize, and simulate the design.

To enable this flow, the user should use the "-pa_defertop" option in vopt command 
and the -pa_top in the vsim command where the "-pa_defertop" option specifies that 
the location of the DUT will be defined later while the "-pa_top" option specifies 
the path from the test bench top to the design top instance.
