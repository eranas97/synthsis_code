This example shows the following Power Aware feature:

    * PA coverage

Preliminary Information
-----------------------
For information about PA coverage support, please visit the Power Aware User 
Manual, Chapter 6 "Power Aware Coverage".


Running the example
-------------------
A do file "run.do" has been included with this example in order to help you compile, 
optimize, and simulate the design. The "-pa_coverage=checks" option is needed with the 
vopt command to enable PA coverage for dynamic checks and "-coverage" option is needed 
in the vsim command to enable the power states coverage.

This example contains 4 power domains and the add_power_states command is used to describe 
the states of these power domain. Also there are isolation, level shifter, and retention 
strategies applied on these power domains.

The simulation tried to hit the different power states of these power domains and firing 
different power aware dynamic checks.

after the end of simulation, the "coverage report -pa -detail" command is used to report 
the coverage information for both the power states and dynamic checks.
