This example shows the Xprop feature:

The example is a simple Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) that is modeled in Verilog. The design contains several multiplexors and flip-flops which are important sources for X propagation.Due to SystemVerilog X-pessimism, the critical code sections are instrumented by Xprop utility in order to verify X-propagation in RTL simulation.

For more information regarding X propagation in simulation and different Xprop modes, please refer to User's Manual, Advanced Simulation Techniques chapter, X Propagation in Simulation section.

By running the example, user can view Xprop instrumented assertions by the tool which fire when the signal in any critical code section goes to X. User can further debug the assertions and identify the source of X.

In Pass mode, All x-scenarios in the which can cause RTL-GLS mismatches design are identified. These scenarios are instrumented in order to be more GLS compatible (i.e. x-pessimistic).

Example:

# ** Error: XPROP_COMB_75: 'select' goes X.
#    Time: 13 ns  Scope: tb.T1.G1.B_mux File: mux_ff.v Line: 75

@13 ns, "select" goes to X in the following expression:

   case (select)
       0 : q = d1;
       1 : q = d2;
   endcase
