Introduction:
=============

This is a simulation of a Video Poker circuit with corresponding GUI in Tcl/Tk.
The design is currently in Verilog only.  Because of it's dependency on Tcl/Tk,
it will only run in ModelSim/EE, not PE.

Version History:
================

[vidpoker.tcl]
# v0.1 - Initial Release 
# v0.2 - Modified to work with 5.1*
# v0.3 - 1) Switched selection around.  Now you select what to keep.
#        2) Deal now pauses between cards for effect, Draw now turns over 
#           discards, waits, then releals, pausing between cards.  Looks good.
# v0.4 - Limited bet to no more than you have.  Fixed cheat so you only get taxed, not rewarded.
# v0.5 - 1) Turned status line into a three line scrollable text widget.
#        2) Added bankroll comments.  If you bust, you get more money.
# v0.6 - The bet was not being deducted from bankroll at Deal time.  Shouldn't then deduct it again
#        if the player fails to get Jacks or Better.
# v0.7 - Made seed get redriven each hand for even more randomness
# v0.8 - Fixed a reference to a Windows specific background color (SystemMenu).  Made it more generic.
# v0.9 - changed calls to 'exa' to explicit 'examine' to avoid ambiguity.
# v1.0 - Added AutoPlay
############################################

Setup:
======

Be sure there is a subdirectory named "Images" below the 
source directory.  It's required and must contain the images
necessary to run the application.

Building the Design:
====================

[Bring up ModelSim, type the following from the prompt]
cd <source_directory> [where the design code is located]
source compile.do
source vidpoker.tcl

Running the application:
========================
1) Press Deal.
2) Select the cards to keep.
3) Press Draw
4) Repeat

Notes:
- You can change the bet size between hands but before hitting
  the Deal button
- The Tcl application generates and drives the seed for the random 
  number generator into the design, providing better "randomness"
- The application will autoplay.  For a nice show, select:
  Simulation->Display top level in Wave Window
  Simulation->Auto Play
