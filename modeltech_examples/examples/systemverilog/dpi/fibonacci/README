This example shows the following SystemVerilog features:

    * Direct Programming interface (DPI)

The example has a simple C algorithm for computing a Fibonacci sequence.  The
C function is called directly by the verilog code using a SystemVerilog
mechanism called the Direct Programming Interface (DPI).  This mechanism is
explained in detail in the User's manual.

This DPI example can be used along with the verilog PLI version in the
examples/verilog/pli/fibonacci directory to examine the differences between
the two interfaces.  The testbench is set up to call this function in a loop
so relative performance can be measured.
