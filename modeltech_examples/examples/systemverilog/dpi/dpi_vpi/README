This example shows the following SystemVerilog features:

    * Direct Programming interface (DPI)

Some testbench languages allow you to use dynamic strings to connect to design
signals.  Besides being able to use hierarchical names directly in
SystemVerilog, you can also pass signals by reference and use virtual
interfaces which essentially give you pointers to signals.  Generate
statements can create iterated references to arrayed instances.  There is also
signal aliasing to group and ungroup bits of a bus.

With VPI, SystemVerilog has the ability to do all sorts of programmable
connections to the design, much more powerful than what you can do with simple
strings.  Even more powerful is the ability to access the VPI using the DPI to
get built-in language introspection.
